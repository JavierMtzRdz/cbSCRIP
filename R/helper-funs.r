#' Calculate Mean Squared Error for Selected Coefficients
#'
#' This function computes the Mean Squared Error (MSE) *only* for the
#' coefficients that were selected by the model (i.e., are non-zero).
#'
#' @note This is not a standard MSE or bias calculation, but rather the
#'   "Mean Squared Error of the selected coefficients." It measures how
#'   accurately the model estimated the parameters it *thought* were important.
#'
#' @param coef A numeric vector of estimated coefficients from a model.
#' @param true_coefs A numeric vector of the same length as `coef` containing
#'   the true, underlying coefficient values.
#'
#' @return A single numeric value representing the mean squared error of the
#'   non-zero elements in `coef` against the corresponding elements in
#'   `true_coefs`. Returns `NaN` if no coefficients are selected (which
#'   can be handled with `na.rm = TRUE` in a downstream `mean()` call).
#'

mse_bias <- function(coef, true_coefs) {
    # Find the indices of coefficients the model *selected* (non-zero)
    indices <- which(coef != 0)
    
    # Calculate MSE only for those selected coefficients
    mse <- mean((coef[indices] - true_coefs[indices])^2)
    return(mse)
}


#' Calculate Variable Selection Performance Metrics
#'
#' Compares a vector of estimated coefficients against a vector of true
#' coefficients to compute common variable selection performance metrics,
#' including sensitivity, specificity, and Matthew's Correlation Coefficient (MCC).
#'
#' @param model_coef A numeric vector of estimated coefficients from a model.
#' @param true_coef A numeric vector of the same length as `model_coef`
#'   containing the true, underlying coefficient values.
#' @param threshold A small numeric value (default: `1e-6`) below which
#'   a coefficient's absolute value is considered to be zero.
#'
#' @return A data.frame with one row containing the following columns:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item `TP`: True Positives (model correctly selected a non-zero-effect variable)
#'   \item `TN`: True Negatives (model correctly did not select a zero-effect variable)
#'   \item `FP`: False Positives (model incorrectly selected a zero-effect variable)
#'   \item `FN`: False Negatives (model incorrectly did not select a non-zero-effect variable)
#'   \item `Sensitivity`: Rate of true positives (TP / (TP + FN))
#'   \item `Specificity`: Rate of true negatives (TN / (TN + FP))
#'   \item `MCC`: Matthew's Correlation Coefficient, a balanced metric for
#'     binary classification that is robust to class imbalance. Ranges
#'     from -1 (total disagreement) to +1 (perfect agreement), with 0
#'     being random chance.
