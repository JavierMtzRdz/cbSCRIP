\title{Calculate Variable Selection Performance Metrics}
\usage{
varsel_perc(model_coef, true_coef, threshold = 1e-08)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_coef}{A numeric vector of estimated coefficients from a model.}

\item{true_coef}{A numeric vector of the same length as \code{model_coef}
containing the true, underlying coefficient values.}

\item{threshold}{A small numeric value (default: \code{1e-6}) below which
a coefficient's absolute value is considered to be zero.}
}
\value{
A data.frame with one row containing the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{TP}: True Positives (model correctly selected a non-zero-effect variable)
\item \code{TN}: True Negatives (model correctly did not select a zero-effect variable)
\item \code{FP}: False Positives (model incorrectly selected a zero-effect variable)
\item \code{FN}: False Negatives (model incorrectly did not select a non-zero-effect variable)
\item \code{Sensitivity}: Rate of true positives (TP / (TP + FN))
\item \code{Specificity}: Rate of true negatives (TN / (TN + FP))
\item \code{MCC}: Matthew's Correlation Coefficient, a balanced metric for
binary classification that is robust to class imbalance. Ranges
from -1 (total disagreement) to +1 (perfect agreement), with 0
being random chance.
}
}
\description{
Compares a vector of estimated coefficients against a vector of true
coefficients to compute common variable selection performance metrics,
including sensitivity, specificity, and Matthew's Correlation Coefficient (MCC).
