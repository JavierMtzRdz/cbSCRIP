\title{Calculate Mean Squared Error for Selected Coefficients}
\usage{
mse_bias(coef, true_coefs)
}
\arguments{
\item{coef}{A numeric vector of estimated coefficients from a model.}

\item{true_coefs}{A numeric vector of the same length as \code{coef} containing
the true, underlying coefficient values.}
}
\value{
A single numeric value representing the mean squared error of the
non-zero elements in \code{coef} against the corresponding elements in
\code{true_coefs}. Returns \code{NaN} if no coefficients are selected (which
can be handled with \code{na.rm = TRUE} in a downstream \code{mean()} call).
}
\description{
This function computes the Mean Squared Error (MSE) \emph{only} for the
coefficients that were selected by the model (i.e., are non-zero).
}
\note{
This is not a standard MSE or bias calculation, but rather the
"Mean Squared Error of the selected coefficients." It measures how
accurately the model estimated the parameters it \emph{thought} were important.
